# Ecolog

## Introduction
EcoLog offers a convenient, one-stop platform for finding disposal methods for various items, as well as their environmentally friendly alternative. The intent is for the user to gain insight on the products they consume (i.e. its impact on the environment), and to build sustainable consumerist habits while encouraging the proper disposal of items.
